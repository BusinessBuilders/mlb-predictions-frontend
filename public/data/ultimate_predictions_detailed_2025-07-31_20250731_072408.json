        "reasoning": "The strongest factor in predicting the away team's victory is their recent form, boasting a 13-7 record and a +2.2 run differential over the last 20 games. This indicates a team performing well above average, especially compared to the home team's 10-10 record. The hot batter system highlights Jonah Heim and Josh Jung as scorching, with significant recent performance improvements, which could be pivotal in generating runs. Additionally, the away team's bullpen is ranked #1 with a 3.57 ERA, providing a substantial advantage in maintaining leads late in the game. While the home team has a slight edge in starting pitcher quality, this is offset by the away team's bullpen and offensive momentum. The convergence of these factors suggests a strong case for the away team's victory, with the market potentially undervaluing the impact of the away team's bullpen and hot batters.",
