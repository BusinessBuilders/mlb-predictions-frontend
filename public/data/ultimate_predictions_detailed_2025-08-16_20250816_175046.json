The away team's superior performance against left-handed pitching (0.790 OPS) is significant given the matchup. Additionally, the away team is currently classified as having hot momentum, which contrasts with the home team's neutral status. The Pythagorean win percentage further supports the away team with a 57.9% likelihood of winning, compared to the home team's 48.0%. The bullpen rankings also favor the away team, with a better ERA and ranking. Although the home team has a slight venue advantage, the overall convergence of these factors suggests a higher probability of an away victory.",
