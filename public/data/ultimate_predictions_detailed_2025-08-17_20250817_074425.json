The hot batter system highlights Taylor Ward and Luis Rengifo as scorching, which is crucial given the offensive boost they provide.

Additionally, the home team has a slight bullpen advantage, which could be pivotal in a close game. The venue advantage, albeit small, further supports the home team's edge. Although the H2H record favors the away team, the home team has shown better performance at their venue in these matchups, which could be a deciding factor.
