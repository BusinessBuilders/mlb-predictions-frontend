Additionally, the home team has been in better recent form, with a 13-7 record in the last 20 games and a positive run differential, compared to the away team's 7-13 record. The venue performance further supports the home team, as they have a better OPS and ERA at home. The H2H matchup data shows a slight edge for the home team at Truist Park, reinforcing the prediction.

The most significant edge comes from the pitching matchup, where Shohei Ohtani's quality rating of 49.8 far surpasses Tanner Gordon's 18.9, suggesting a strong likelihood of the away team controlling the game from the mound. Additionally, the away team's bullpen is significantly better, ranked #18 compared to the home team's last-place ranking, which should help maintain any lead established. The recent form and run differential further support the away team's advantage, as they have been performing better overall. The H2H data is particularly compelling, with the away team dominating the matchup historically, winning 7 out of 8 games in the 2024 season. This historical dominance, combined with the current form and pitching advantage, creates a strong case for the away team.
