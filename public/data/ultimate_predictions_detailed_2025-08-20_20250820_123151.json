The head-to-head matchup history also favors the away team, which has won 75% of their games against the home team this season, with a positive run differential. The Pythagorean win percentage further supports the away team's edge, indicating a higher expected win rate. Despite the home team's slight pitcher advantage, the overall convergence of bullpen strength, recent form, and head-to-head success gives the away team the upper hand.
