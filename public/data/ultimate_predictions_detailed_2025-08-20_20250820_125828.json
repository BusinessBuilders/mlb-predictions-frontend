Additionally, the hot batter system highlights Brooks Lee and Trevor Larnach as key contributors, outperforming their season averages, which could provide the offensive edge needed. While the home team has a slight bullpen advantage, the away team's starting pitcher, J.T. Ginn, has a better quality rating than Bailey Ober, suggesting a potential starting pitching edge. The H2H matchup shows the home team with a slight edge, but the away team's recent form and individual player performances suggest they can overcome this.
